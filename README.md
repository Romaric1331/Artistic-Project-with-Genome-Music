# Artistic Project with Genome Music

This interdisciplinary team project involves students from various tracks at the Learning Planet Institute - Université Paris Cité. The project aims to showcase the impact of antibiotic resistance by translating the genomic structure of Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria into music.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To create music based on the genomic structure of Helicobacter Pylori Bacteria.
- **Tools**: The music is generated in Python using the midiutil library, which offers a variety of built-in musical instruments that are mixed to produce the final output.
- **License**: MIT License
